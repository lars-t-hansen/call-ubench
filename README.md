# call-ubench

Microbenchmarks for wasm function calls, collected from various
sources.  See run.sh for some rudimentary information.

The fib benchmarks are newer, they take a principled approach to
exploring all the cases.

The sub-add benchmarks are older, they are a little ad-hoc still, and
there are some TODOs.  Use with care.

To see summary information about the programs, `grep INFO *.js`
